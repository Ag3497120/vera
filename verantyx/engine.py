"""One boundary. The composition lives here, not in whoever is calling.

Why
---
The composition used to live in the caller. `veraModelTurn` in the IDE's
Swift decides — in Swift — whether a question is a difference, when to
re-ask with the last core as context, and which of the payload's thirty-one
fields become the reply. Measured today: the IDE knows 60 of the 99 doors
and its answering path uses three, so seventeen organs and about six
thousand lines are outside every question anyone asks. A different client
picks a different three and the same engine looks like a different
product — which is exactly what happened when one session measured the
CLI's v0 door and reported it as "the engine".

So the order moves here. A caller asks one thing and gets everything the
engine knows how to bring, and a new binding inherits the whole
composition instead of re-deriving a worse one.

Layered, never pooled
---------------------
Each stage hands the next a better question or annotates the answer.
Nothing here merges two notions of agreement into one vote — that
direction is measured at 6 failures out of 6, against 5 improvements out
of 5 for layering. `ask` still does the answering; this arranges what
reaches it and what is said about what comes back.

What is deliberately absent
---------------------------
No model is called. Nothing is written to the store. Both are properties
worth more than the reach they cost: the first keeps the same question
answering the same way forever, and the second keeps this file from ever
becoming a place where a claim quietly enters.
