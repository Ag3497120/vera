# Verantyx Vera α

**A model-free knowledge and reasoning research engine with source evidence and typed refusals.**

Vera stores knowledge as *crosses* — one per concept, with a core meaning and
accumulating factual facets — and reasons by **multi-frontier consensus
search**: several sections explore toward a center, and an answer ships only
when they agree with sufficient evidence. Everything else is a **typed
refusal**:

```text
ANSWER · AMBIGUOUS · UNKNOWN_NO_EVIDENCE · UNKNOWN_INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE ·
UNKNOWN_SECTION_DISAGREEMENT · UNKNOWN_BUDGET · UNKNOWN_NO_SOLUTION · …
```

No neural network. No GPU. No sampling temperature. Same input, same output,
every time — and every answer traces back to counted source sentences.

`Vera(mode="round5").ask(raw)` is the experimental normal router for A semantic
QA, B code contracts and C content plans. It selects from the raw request alone;
ambiguous intent or a component refusal never retries an older answer path.
Explicit diagnostic modes are `semantic`, `contract` and `content`. B revision r3
is integrated after cleanup, process-group observation and asymmetric verifier
witness corrections. Its final OS regression produced nonempty SQL for two raw
requests (24 independent finite oracle checks) and rejected two semantic mutants
after successful execution. All eight owned children were reclaimed. These
are authored regressions, not B80 acceptance, arbitrary code-generation accuracy
or a 50 ms result; POSIX execution remains held. C can construct
finite licensed prose, but its whole-request step accounting is incomplete:
the public adapter reports `experimental=True`, `adoption_eligible=False`,
`budget.accounting_complete=False` and `budget.steps_total=None`.
`CREATED` means fictional construction, not a verified factual answer or literary
quality score. The latest implementation, evidence and unfinished work are in
[the current Claude integration handoff](docs/CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_HANDOFF_2026-09-30.md).

For an explicitly selected, checkpointed material pack, use
`Vera(mode="round5", round3_root=base_qa, material_root=approved_materials,
material_immutable=True)`. The material root is separate from factual QA indexes.
Immutable reading refuses nonempty WAL/journal files; the caller must verify and
pin the release manifest first. Synthetic materials remain unverified expressions.

`verantyx.meaning_bridge.source_event_realizations(raw_documents)` is a separate
diagnostic for one source-attributed event. It retains the full source View,
maps the supported roles/polarity/tense into C's grammar, and checks the emitted
meaning. Unsupported scope, aspect and mood are held. Its result is
`DIAGNOSTIC_REALIZATION`, never a completed user Goal or general-generation
score; `adoption_eligible` remains false. See the handoff for the small positive
and fault-injection checks and the remaining shared-parser limitations.

## Historical component measurements — 2026-08

These older component measurements concern their original versions and scopes.
They are not end-to-end Round5 accuracy, latency, or generalization results.
See the current status above before interpreting them as a capability claim.

| | measured |
|---|---|
| Federation | **89,369 cores**, repaired 2026-08-14 (103,599 rule-shaped false facets removed, ledger kept) |
| Typed negation | observed `¬` testimony, gated on a real lemma — **97/97** on the reported component test |
| Unknown-word explanation | units grounded in sourced definitions — **81 of 91** remaining holes fully grounded |
| Structural difference | exclusivity **0.9715** — "no attestation for B", never "B is not" |
| Connective prose | **243/243** placements carry a licence; 「しかし」 only on an observed ¬ pair |
| Instruction frames | 48 verbs × 28 operations — out-of-table refusal last measured at **15/15 on the 47-verb table**, not re-run since 見る was added |
| Multi-stage chains | arrows derived deterministically — **0/18** false splits |
| Typo recovery | recovery@5 **84.8%**, false fires on real words **0/500**, 2.15 ms |
| Mathematics | **75,919 of 77,242** mathlib theorems carry `verified:lean4:4.34.0-rc1` from real kernel runs (98.9% of files) |
| Cold start | shallow shelf took the hole rate **74.5% → 45.5%** |
| Meaning by association | kin prediction covers 140/150 at **10× chance — and 4% of a word's own facets is the ceiling** |
| Commonsense | **9/50**. Two pre-registered ConceptNet imports both PARKED (29/20, 28/21) — no usable source found |

Doors: **94** over MCP (`vera_ask`, `vera_diff`, `vera_explain`, `vera_intent`,
`vera_typo`, `vera_math`, `vera_summarize`, `memory_ledger`, `survey_assets`,
`assets_for`, `record_tool_witness`, `record_asset_outcome`, …).

### Sovereigns stay apart

Only the federation votes. mathlib witnesses, the jawiki sidecars (941,604
aliases, 122,988 sense surfaces, definition sentences, predicate profiles),
the gap map and the parked ConceptNet import are hand-off only, and
`MANIFEST.json` says so in its first sentence. Merging two stores whose
notion of "agreement" differs was measured six times and broke six times —
out-of-corpus words reaching quorum 0 → 8, 284 answers becoming 208.

### Where the machine itself is knowledge

An agent that cannot do something here can ask what else this computer has.
Four tiers, never collapsed:

```text
present   it exists            — a fact anyone can check by looking
declares  Info.plist says so   — the vendor's claim, attributable
verified  a run proved it      — record_tool_witness, earned
chosen    it closed this need  — record_asset_outcome, remembered
```

A change in the machine opens a `GapNode` (ASSET_ARRIVED / ASSET_GONE) rather
than passing silently, and the second time a need appears the answer is a
lookup instead of another exploration.

## In the IDE

[Verantyx IDE](https://github.com/Ag3497120/Verantyx) ships Vera as a native
child process (stdio JSON-RPC, no MCP registry in the path) and offers five
modes: **jgen council / Vera-a (dual path) / Vera (store alone, no LLM) / Bot
(settings & UI) / LLM**.

- **The stereo cross is the route, not a logo.** It is a watermark across the
  whole surface, lit by the real call — and only the arms the answer actually
  evidenced. An arm with no cue stays grey, because a fact without a surface
  cue has no arm.
- **The reply is a console, not a bubble**: ANSWER (with verdict, grain,
  witnesses) / EVIDENCE (named sources) / CONFLICT / **GAP — never an error.**
  Declining *is* the answer.
- **Memory is reviewable.** A ledger row moves from 証言 to 「ユーザーの校正」
  by a person, and the review state lives beside the cross, never inside it:
  an approval is not testimony the corpus gave.
- **Surfaces are summoned by name** from a closed table — say 設定 / 記憶 /
  画面 / モード. Anything unmatched falls through untouched.
- **An attached document is offered, never taken**: 「入れますか?」 → 「はい」
  ingests; anything else leaves it in the conversation only.

## Earlier contradiction-detector measurements

This section describes the earlier contradiction detector and its original
measurements. The current QA, construction and generation goals are listed
in the status block above.

| corpus | detections | true | precision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Japanese government disaster reports (5 corpora, 4 read blind) | 14 | 14 | **100%** |
| Technical prose — 93 mixed EN/JA project documents | 5 | **0** | **0%** |

The difference is not the subject matter. It is whether the documents make
**state claims about named entities**.

**It works** where the same *named* thing — a municipality, a facility, a
route, a service, a contract, an asset — is described by more than one source,
and its state changes: open/closed, running/stopped, valid/expired,
in-service/withdrawn. That shape is what the engine detects, and on it, it does
not guess.

**It does not work** on prose. In technical writing the same abstract noun
returns in unrelated contexts — 「議論」, 「出力」, 「推論プロセス」 — and
comparing two of them produces a contradiction that was never there. All five
findings on that corpus were false, and the honest reading is that a wiki, a
set of design docs, or meeting notes are the wrong input.

It is also **not** a document organiser: no summarising, no tagging, no
clustering, no semantic search. It answers one question — *do my sources
disagree about this thing, and who said what* — and refuses the rest.

The earlier parser also found bugs in **its own reading**, without an answer key: it
reads the same documents twice through a transform that cannot change what
they say, and a claim that appears in only one of the two readings is provably
spurious. 13 real defects found that way, repaired unattended.
[docs/METAMORPHIC.md](docs/METAMORPHIC.md).

## Why

| LLM | Vera |
|-----|------|
| Answers everything, sometimes wrongly | Answers only what it can ground, refuses the rest |
| Knowledge baked into weights | Knowledge is data — inspect, count, **delete for real** |
| Arithmetic is probabilistic | Arithmetic is exact by construction (wire carry propagation) |
| GBs of weights + GPU | A JSON store + CPU; a 900k-concept store is ~200 MB |
| Forgetting is an open research problem | `vera forget apple` — gone |

Research areas include **source-grounded knowledge QA**,
**persistent memory for agents (via MCP)**, **code reasoning**
(who-calls / impact analysis), exact **arithmetic / equations / term
rewriting / Kripke model checking**.

Creative writing, small talk and free-form generation remain goals. Their
current limitations are not a decision to exclude them from the project.

## Install

```bash
pip install verantyx-vera            # core — standard library only
pip install "verantyx-vera[docs]"    # + PDF, Word, Excel
pip install "verantyx-vera[mcp]"     # + MCP server
```

Python ≥ 3.9. The basic symbolic core has no additional dependencies. Japanese
document parsing and the experimental Round5-A `semantic` mode use Fugashi and
the bundled UniDic-lite dictionary. Install them from this checkout with:

```bash
python3.11 -m pip install -e ".[ja]"
```

The `all` extra includes these Japanese dependencies too. The dictionary is
installed with the package; no dictionary download, GPU or network is needed
when answering. Round5-A's experimental mode is selected explicitly through
the Python API and does not establish that the project's capability goals
have passed independent evaluation:

```python
from verantyx.one import Vera

vera = Vera.from_texts({"note": "ナオの担当はミオ。"}, mode="semantic")
answer = vera.ask("ナオの担当は誰？")
print(answer["verdict"], answer["values"])
```

Then, for the local app a non-programmer can use:

```bash
vera field       # opens on 127.0.0.1 — documents never leave the machine
```

Step-by-step, written for someone who has never opened a terminal:
<https://verantyx.ai/vera/download/>

## Quickstart

```bash
# teach a fact — usable immediately, no training
vera remember "The bright apple is sweet ."

# ask — grounded answer with provenance counts
vera ask "what is apple"
# → ANSWER "apple bright sweet"

# ask something it was never taught
vera ask "what is quantum chromodynamics"
# → UNKNOWN_NO_EVIDENCE  (it says so, instead of making something up)

# exact math on the same substrate
vera math "solve x + 3 = 7"        # → ANSWER x=4
vera math "x * 0 = 0"              # → AMBIGUOUS (many solutions — no vote)
vera simplify "(2 + 3) * y"        # → 5 * y   (rule trace included)

# interactive session (knowledge + math + code in one REPL)
vera chat
```

## Chat modes: lab & hybrid (a local LLM under Vera's control)

```bash
vera chat --mode lab                      # deterministic only (default)
vera chat --mode hybrid --llm qwen3.5:2b  # local Ollama model, Vera allocates
```

In **hybrid** mode Vera stays the controller; the local model is only the
language surface. Allocation is deterministic and every reply is labeled:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `[math]` / `[code]` | exact routes — the LLM is **never** allowed to touch proven values |
| `[llm←vera-facts]` | Vera answered; the LLM only rephrases Vera's verified facts |
| `[llm UNVERIFIED]` | Vera has nothing; the LLM may converse, explicitly unverified |
| `UNKNOWN_*` | genuine ambiguity stays refused — the LLM cannot vote it away |

**Native memory harness** (no MCP, no triggers): in chat, every declarative
utterance is remembered automatically; questions and imperatives are not
(so "tell me something" never becomes a fake fact). Disable with
`--no-auto-memory`.

**Multi-line paste**: `vera chat` and `vera agent` capture a pasted block
(traceback, multi-sentence note, JSON) as one message instead of splitting
it line by line — plain `input()` submits on every embedded newline, which
silently mangles pastes. This uses bracketed-paste mode and needs a real
TTY; piped/non-interactive input falls back to reading one line at a time.

### Explicit experimental Round5 chat

To send each conversational message through the same raw-request
`one.Vera.ask` entry used by `vera ask --mode round5`, opt in explicitly:

```bash
/Users/motonishikoudai/Projects/vera-round5-run/env/bin/python -m verantyx.cli chat --mode round5 --document ./memo.txt
```

The document is loaded into this chat process for the current session; pass
`--document` again on the next launch. The typed message is passed directly to
`one.Vera.ask` without a generated prompt template. The current source-event
slice is narrow: unsupported or ambiguous requests remain held, and a
source-bound paraphrase may be reported as `PARTIAL`, with its projection
checks, evidence reference, and unverified whole-Goal status shown in the
terminal. A displayed source is evidence for the expression only; it does not
establish that the source claim is true. `lab` remains the default, and the
Round5 route does not replace the normal router.

## Reversible obfuscation, keyed by your personal store state

```bash
pip install -e ".[obfuscate]"
vera obfuscate billing.py --export-key recovery.key   # → billing.py.obf + .obfmap
vera deobfuscate billing.py.obf billing.py.obfmap --key-file recovery.key
```

Identifiers are renamed via exact AST positions (never touches string
literals or docstrings); the reversal mapping is AES-256-GCM-encrypted
with a key derived from your store's own accumulated state — real, unique
per person, and never from hiding the (public) algorithm. Full rationale
and honest limits: [docs/OBFUSCATE.md](docs/OBFUSCATE.md).

## First-run setup

```bash
vera setup       # arrow-key menu: pick a local Ollama model + the allocation
                 # dial (which domains Vera owns vs where the LLM may speak),
                 # saved to ~/.verantyx.json
```

## Agent mode (hands and feet)

A ReAct loop where **Vera is the controller** and tools do real work — file
edits, folder/file creation, shell commands, and web search — each mutating
action gated behind **arrow-key approval**:

```bash
vera agent "read README.md and tell me the license"
vera agent          # interactive; ↑/↓ + Enter to approve/deny each action
```

Exact math/code finishes with no LLM and no tools; web search is a stdlib
DuckDuckGo client (no API key). Full details: [docs/AGENT_MODE.md](docs/AGENT_MODE.md).

## Guided data placement

```bash
vera wizard      # arrow-key: choose a corpus + row budget, then it pours
```

## Base store from HuggingFace (no local store needed)

Vera ships no weights; the artifact is the poured store. Publish it once,
and any fresh checkout fetches it automatically:

```bash
vera push-store --repo <user>/Verantyx-Vera-base-store   # upload (needs HF login)
# later, on any machine: if no local store exists and hf_store_repo is set
# in ~/.verantyx.json, `vera ask ...` fetches the base store on first use.
```

**Live base store:** [`kofdai/Verantyx-Vera-base-store`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kofdai/Verantyx-Vera-base-store)
— 889k concept crosses / 9.78M facet links (WikiText-2/103, ag_news, DBpedia,
SQuAD, IMDB). Set it once and any fresh checkout works with knowledge already
inside:

```bash
vera setup    # or edit ~/.verantyx.json: "hf_store_repo": "kofdai/Verantyx-Vera-base-store"
vera ask "what is football"    # auto-fetches the base store on first use
```

## The jgen static dictionary (optional)

Vera grows its vocabulary from the documents themselves and a person approves
each word. To put the likely-real candidates in front of that person first, it
can consult a **jgen** — a local model file converted with `--parts lexicon`,
carrying its embedding table and nothing else. It has no layers that generate,
so it physically cannot write. It is opened once and read a row at a time:
pure standard library, no inference engine, no network.

Three questions, and the measurement that decided each — on qwen 0.5b
(152k x 1024) against the engine's own 31-term vocabulary:

| question | verdict | measured |
|---|---|---|
| Is this the kind of word that carries a state? | usable | separates the real proposal queue completely — true candidates +0.164 / +0.128 / +0.082, false ones −0.143 / −0.239 |
| Which known words sit nearest? | usable as search | 冠水 → 断水 (0.52), 停電 → 停止 (0.47) |
| **Which pole is it — restored, or still out?** | **refused; absent from the API** | **64.5% leave-one-out — a coin flip.** A 4B model scored 54.8% on the same test |

The third row is why the other two are worth stating. Opposite poles live in
identical contexts — an outage and its restoration share a paragraph — so a
frozen embedding table holds no information that separates them. No function
in `jgen_lexicon` returns a pole, and an eval asserts the absence.

The dictionary **orders** the queue and accepts nothing. Acceptance stays with
a person, and that boundary comes from the number rather than from caution.

```bash
# build one from a model you already have
python3 jgen_forge.py pull qwen3.5:4b --parts lexicon

# point Vera at it — entirely optional
cat > ~/.verantyx-audit/lexicon.json <<'JSON'
{"jgen": "/path/to/x_lexicon_full.jgen",
 "tokenizer": "/path/to/x.jgen.tokenizer/tokenizer.json"}
JSON

vera lexicon 冠水 滞留 孤立        # ask it directly
```

Without one configured the queue simply arrives unsorted, and nothing else
changes.

## Languages

The cross substrate is symbol-agnostic; segmentation is per-language:

- **English** — full elementary-grammar pipeline (richest)
- **Japanese** — tokenizer-free script-run segmentation
  (`リンゴは甘い果物です` → core リンゴ, facets 甘い/果物; recall + typed refusal)
- **Spanish / French / German** — generic content-word path with per-language
  function-word stoplists; other Latin-script languages fall back to a shared list

`vera chat --lang auto` detects per utterance; force with `--lang ja` etc.

## Pouring corpora (bulk knowledge)

```bash
# built-in synthetic corpus (offline smoke test)
vera pour --source synthetic --max-rows 2000

# WikiText-2 from the HuggingFace cache
vera pour --source wikitext --max-rows 40000

# any HuggingFace dataset:  hf:<name>[#config][:text_field]
vera pour --source "hf:ag_news" --max-rows 120000
vera pour --source "hf:dbpedia_14:content" --max-rows 560000
vera pour --source "hf:wikitext#wikitext-103-raw-v1" --max-rows 2000000

# a local text file (one document per line)
vera pour --source file:corpus.txt
```

Pouring is deterministic and resumable (`--store` is a JSON checkpoint;
pouring again accumulates). A two-pass capitalization scan routes proper
names to their own sense channel (`bush#p` ≠ `bush`). Reference run: WikiText-2
+ ag_news + DBpedia + WikiText-103 ≈ **870k concept crosses / 9.2M facet
links**, poured in minutes on a laptop CPU.

More detail: [docs/ADDING_KNOWLEDGE.md](docs/ADDING_KNOWLEDGE.md).

## Code reasoning

```bash
vera code ingest path/to/repo          # AST → one cross per function
vera code ask "who calls wire_add"     # reverse call edges
vera code ask "what does simplify call"
vera code ask "impact of parse_term"   # BFS: what may break if it changes
```

Unknown functions get `UNKNOWN_NO_EVIDENCE`, not a guess.

**Bug localization by agreement** (`verantyx.debug_consensus.locate_bug`):
traceback, recent-diff, and failing-test sections each nominate cause
functions; a cause is asserted only when the sections agree — otherwise a
typed UNKNOWN with the disagreement map. The `DEBUG_BEATS_BASELINES` fork
shows the consensus resisting noise that fools a most-recently-changed
baseline. See [docs/CODE_REASONING.md](docs/CODE_REASONING.md).

## MCP server (memory & knowledge tools for LLM agents)

Vera also supplies source-linked external memory for Claude Code /
Claude Desktop or any MCP client:

```bash
pip install -e ".[mcp]"
vera --store ~/vera_memory.json mcp
```

Tools exposed: `ask`, `remember`, `recall`, `forget`, `math`,
`code_ingest`, `code_query`, `stats`. Setup snippets:
[docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md).

## Lab mode (self-test forks)

Every capability is guarded by falsifiable "fork" tests — including the
refusal behaviors:

```bash
vera lab        # 41 forks: consensus gates, pouring, math, rewriting, Kripke,
                # languages, router allocation, debug consensus, memory
                # provenance/contradiction, SQLite round-trip
```

## Memory with provenance & contradiction detection

```python
from verantyx import CrossStore
st = CrossStore(track_provenance=True)
st.add("server:prod-1", ["os:ubuntu"], source="infra sheet 7/24")
st.add("server:prod-1", ["os:debian"], source="slack 7/25")
st.contradictions("server:prod-1")
# → key "os" holds two values, each with counts, timestamps, and sources
```

`key:value` facets are exclusive per key: different stored values are reported
with both sources. This detects a stored key/value conflict; it does not establish
which source is true or detect all contradictions in natural language.

## SQLite backend (scale & fast writes)

```python
from verantyx import save_sqlite, load_sqlite, SqliteSync
save_sqlite(store, "big.db")            # distributable single file
st = load_sqlite("big.db")              # or cores_like="fn:%" for a slice
sync = SqliteSync(st, "big.db"); st.add(...); sync.flush()   # delta writes
```

Reference store poured with the same pipeline: WikiText-2 + WikiText-103 +
ag_news + DBpedia + SQuAD + IMDB ≈ **889k cores / 9.78M facet links**.

## Passive memory from AI output (quarantined, never auto-trusted)

```bash
vera propose-ai-facts "The staging DB runs postgres 14. It might also \
support replication, I'm not sure." --source ai_output:claude
# → quarantines "The staging DB runs postgres 14." only —
#   the hedged sentence never becomes a candidate
vera review-ai-facts     # arrow-key accept/reject each pending candidate
```

Nothing proposed here is queryable via `ask` until explicitly accepted —
an LLM's own text (even its final answer) can be wrong or hedged, so it
never writes directly into the trusted store. Same tools over MCP:
`propose_ai_facts` / `list_pending_ai_facts` / `accept_ai_fact` /
`reject_ai_fact`. Rationale: [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md#passive-memory-from-ai-output-quarantined).

## Getting started as a builder

New here? Read [docs/ONBOARDING.md](docs/ONBOARDING.md) — a zero-to-custom
walkthrough (data-path choice, pouring best practices, verification, scale-up,
extension points). Design rationale lives in [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Architecture (one page)

```text
sentence ──classify──▶ core + facets ──accumulate──▶ CrossStore
                                                (core → {facet: count})
query ──decompose──▶ retrieve candidate crosses ──▶ shell (6 arms)
      ──▶ multi-frontier consensus search
           gates:  NoImprovingMove ∧ AllSectionsAgree
                 ∧ EvidenceComplete ∧ QueryGrounded ∧ NoContradiction
      ──▶ ANSWER (facet document) | typed UNKNOWN / AMBIGUOUS
disambiguation:  sense clusters over facet co-occurrence
                 ("sun newspaper" vs "sun in the sky")
layers:          matryoshka — unresolved disagreement is handed upward
math:            digits on arms, carry as current  → exact by construction
rules:           term rewriting; rules are data, poured like knowledge
modal logic:     Kripke worlds = crosses, R = joins, □ = agreement gate
```

Deep dives: [docs/MATRYOSHKA.md](docs/MATRYOSHKA.md) (layer stacking, carry
modes A/B/C), [docs/ADDING_KNOWLEDGE.md](docs/ADDING_KNOWLEDGE.md) (nodes,
facets, sense channels, deletion).

## Honest limitations

- Output is structured facet documents, **not fluent prose** (hybrid mode
  buys fluency from a local LLM, clearly labeled).
- English has the richest pipeline; Japanese is an elementary tokenizer-free
  recall path (no consensus decomposer yet); es/fr/de use a generic
  content-word path.
- Facet extraction is rule-based and shallow; noisy corpora leave noisy
  facets (they are at least *visible* and deletable).
- Same-surface homographs in the same channel can mix; sense clusters
  mitigate at query time but need specifier words.
- Kripke checking is finite-model only; no tableau validity, no proof search.
- Naturals-only arithmetic (6-digit v0); no fractions/negatives yet.
