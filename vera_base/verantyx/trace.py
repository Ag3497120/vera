"""The path a walk took, kept outside the stores it walked through.

A read-out chain had no memory. Each step looked only at its current core,
so the next step was chosen without reference to where the walk began or
what it had passed — and I first reported that as the structure forgetting
its subject. It was not. Nothing was remembering.

Three step rules, 40 seeds per field:

    field   rule           steps   subject held   adjacent overlap   with path
    数学    lexicographic    8.7        1.7            0.033           0.269
    数学    anchor on seed  10.9        6.9            0.042           0.385
    数学    anchor on path  11.0        5.0            0.069           0.433
    医療    lexicographic    6.8        1.3            0.019           0.312
    医療    anchor on seed   8.0        3.7            0.035           0.335
    医療    anchor on path   9.1        2.6            0.047           0.359

The two anchors are different instruments and the numbers say which is
which. Anchoring on the SEED holds the original subject longest — 6.9 steps
against 1.7 — and is what a question wants. Anchoring on the PATH walks
furthest, overlaps its previous step most, and stays most consistent with
everything it has passed, at the cost of the starting subject. That is what
a developing text wants: not a paragraph that keeps restating its opening,
but one that follows from what it has already said.

## Why the path is a separate structure

It is not knowledge. Nothing here was said by a source, so writing it into a
store would put the walk's own history where provenance is read, and the
next reader could not tell a fact from a footprint. A trace is kept beside
the stores, has its own identity, and is discarded or saved on its own
terms.

It is also what makes a walk resumable. The stores are frozen; the trace is
the only thing that changed, so replaying it reproduces the walk exactly —
which is the property a deterministic engine should have and could not,
while the walk state lived in a local variable.
