"""MCP server — hallucination-free memory & knowledge tools over stdio.

Exposes the cross-structure store to MCP clients (Claude Code, Claude

guessing, and `forget` really deletes (knowledge is not baked into weights).

Requires the official MCP Python SDK:  pip install "mcp[cli]"

        Every draft is marked `constructed: True`. 「権利を有する」 being
        well-formed is not a claim that anyone holds a right — this door

        still resolves through the shared tables, and every draft names the
        layer each slot came from (`layer`: the domain / shared / mixed).

        `domain_only` refuses instead of falling through. Layering is right

        organisation's own: a firm asking about 担保 and getting an
        encyclopedia's sense of it is wrong in a way nothing on screen
        shows. Customising for an organisation means declining to leave
        their vocabulary, not editing the shared map — so this is the flag

        `items_closed` is the one thing a caller must be honest about,

    # `sampling` capability — the server asking the client's LLM to generate
    # — is deliberately never invoked: the whole point of this engine is
    # that nothing needs to be sampled. A reply is composed, typed, and
    # sourced, or it is a typed refusal.

    # State: the conversation is the SAME persistent one the other doors
    # read (`add_conversation_turn` / `check_context_drift`), so what is
    # said here is recallable there, and covenants set there bind replies

    # walker's trajectory — an arrangement is not knowledge, and a later

        **Call this door, not the specific ones.** MCP puts the caller in
        charge of which door runs, and a caller that knows three doors gets
        a three-door engine: measured, the IDE knew 60 of the 99 and its
        answering path used three, leaving seventeen organs outside every
        question anyone asked. A different client picked a different three
        and the same engine looked like a different product.

        So this door carries the composition instead of the caller. One
        question goes in and the ordering — intent, staging, typo repair,
        arithmetic, theorem witness, difference, census, context
        completion, meaning descent, arm placement, gap ledger, frame
        composition — happens here, in the measured layering direction.
        The reply names the door that answered and lists every stage with
        what it did, so a caller can see which organs ran rather than
        having to know they exist.

        `last_core` supplies the previous answer's subject, which is what
        makes 「その刑は」 resolvable; `domain` restricts composition to a
        registered document.

        `store_first` decides which of the two spaces gets to be THE
        answer when both have one: this terminal's own documents
        (everything `load_documents` ingested) or the published
        federation. They are never merged — the door name in the reply
        says which space spoke, and when both answered the other one
        rides along under `local`. Default is the federation, because a
        loaded document should not silently take over general questions.
